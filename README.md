Repository for code associated with our paper on the Hamiltonian formulation of active spheroidal particle motion.

See our preprint on arxiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11388

The python_notebooks folder contains several notebooks illustrating how the model equations can be solved using a variety of numerical integration schemes.

The c_code folder contains routines for solving the associated variational problem with the classical RK4 method to expedite Lyapunov exponent calculations.

Additionaly code may be made available on request, contact Brendan Harding.
